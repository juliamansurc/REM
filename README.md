#### Urban Risk Assessment: Mapping Socioeconomic Vulnerability to Landslide Hazards on São Paulo’s Northern Coastline

Abstract: Increasingly salient, the threat of natural hazards poses a risk to communities, disproportionately
affecting socially and economically vulnerable populations. In Brazil, recent precipitation trends
have escalated the incidence of flooding and landslides, with the Northern coast of São Paulo
experiencing, in 2023, 682mm of downpour. As a consequence, 1,730 people were displaced and
1,810 left homeless.7 However, as discussed in Dantas et al.(2025), negative impacts of hydrological
extremes are unevenly distributed across socioeconomic variables, with more severe consequences
concentrated in areas with limited resources. We then investigate the negative correlation between
the allocation of high income housing —proxied by mapping luxury condominiums—and areas most
vulnerable to climate change, emphasizing the impacts of extreme precipitation through employing
change identification techniques in satellite rasters.
